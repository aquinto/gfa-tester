# GFA Tester

The following script was written to calculate which students have met the GFA requirements for a given project.

## Usage

The script was written to account for both manually graded and autograded projects. Manually graded projects such as Processing projects will contain different names for the requirements needed to pass a GFA for that given project, whereas, for autograded projects students only need to pass X amount of public tests to meet a GFA requirement.
